# Design Choices & Next Steps

## Design Philosophy
Prioritized **minimalist aesthetics** with clean typography and restrained color palette, following the brief's emphasis on "Jony Ive simplicity." Used a modern green-based color scheme to convey growth and sustainability, avoiding typical recruitment industry blues.

## Technical Decisions
- **Static-first approach** for fast loading and simple deployment
- **Mobile-responsive design** with progressive enhancement
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox** for flexible, maintainable layouts
- **Semantic HTML** for accessibility and SEO

## Community Integration Vision
Designed modular sections (Community, AI Platform, Dashboard) as foundation for dynamic features. The static broker profiles preview the eventual user-generated content system.

## Next Development Priorities

**Immediate (0-3 months):**
- User authentication and personalized dashboards
- Real-time messaging between brokers
- Basic job posting and candidate matching

**Medium-term (3-6 months):**
- AI-powered candidate recommendations using vector embeddings
- Revenue sharing automation with transparent tracking
- Community reputation system with gamification

**Long-term (6-12 months):**
- Advanced ML models for bias-free matching
- Mobile applications with push notifications
- API integrations with major ATS platforms
- Blockchain-based transparent commission splitting
